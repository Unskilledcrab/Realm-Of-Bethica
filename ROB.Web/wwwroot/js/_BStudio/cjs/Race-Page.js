Their hair is often bright and colorful, ranging from bold reds to raven black among the males while among the females bright blues, deep greens, and virtually any other color imaginable can be seen naturally occurring. Their skin tone like most of the civilized races vary greatly but most commonly ranges from a dark olive to brown. Natural marksmen, the Aenwyn have an uncanny knack with the bow, quickly able to calculate distance, and wind in the blink of an eye, nearly as fast as they can draw an arrow, pull back the bow and loose the arrow itself. Stealth is also that comes naturally to them, and tales from the War of Tears of Aenwyn ambushes leaves little doubt as to their effective use of their gifts."

They usually feature an olive to dark skin tone, though this can vary wildly based on the tributes own appearance. Domari do not age, and none have been known to die of old age, this combined with the lethal nature of their procreation requires them to be very mindful of their numbers. To have a child a Domari must find a suitable tribute, which is then drained of their life force to fuel the pregnancy, and the resulting child may have similar features of both the mother and tribute, similar to births among other races. On Domarina this is a careful process, the tribute is culled from among male slaves reaved from along the coast, and the process is carefully overseen. Always when done according to the laws and tradition of Domarina the slave is given a fair chance to earn his freedom through ceremonial combat. If he wins, he is freed if he loses he is drained then and there."

    racialDescData: "Engamar is a short and stocky humanoid race, rarely growing over four and a half feet in height on average. Their bodies are thickset, more so than most others, with broad shoulders and limbs. Considered hairy by some of the other civilized races, they take pride in their hair and beards, often having complex braiding and decoration. Unlike some races their forms do not grow weaker with age, an engamar retains his strength until his end. Even their hair does not grey until very near the end of their lifespan, retaining its luster and color for most of their lives. Unique among the civilized races they do not give birth to their offspring, at least as other races know it. Instead, they craft their children, carving them from a sacred stone, called Engadine, mined deep from within the earth, and then infuse it with a part of their own essence to give it life. This act requires an engamar to have lived a full life; those who have never truly experienced life lack the vitality to infuse the sacred stone. This is why the greatest of engamar heroes also tend to have large numbers of offspring. Though possible for a singular engamar to create a child, most often the process of life forging involves an engamar couple doing so together so that the child has a part of them both in it. Engamar is also known to have a surprisingly adept palate, able to discern a great deal from the taste, which combined with their excellent eye sight in both low light and total darkness allows them to be surprisingly perceptive."

    racialDescData: "Granben is often referred to as the little folk and standing at half or less the height of most of the civilized races of Bethica it is not surprising why. Their size combined with their seemingly irrepressible optimism and cheer often makes other see them as childlike, a sentiment that the Granben do everything to perpetuate. They are as varied in appearance as the Volari, with skin tone and hair color that runs the gamut, with brown hair and a dark tan skin tone being the most common. Their eyes are a range in color from green to yellow or brown. Though physically small, the Granben are not to be considered weak, or timid. Indeed it is rare that one exhibits fear even in the most dangerous of situations. This perhaps only helps enable their other unique trait, a compulsion to steal things and explore. In most cases, this behavior is indulged as a racial past time, but some choose to revel in it, becoming skilled thieves and pickpockets in the process. Regardless of their intent, this has left them with a poor reputation among merchants and vendors among the cities in which significant populations of Granben live. Many will hide âGranben potsâ around their establishment, a small vessel holding valueless trinkets or stones, a concession that acknowledges the Granbens occasional urges and hopes they will avail themselves of such items instead of their valuable goods."

Comparable in looks to an over-sized Volari, the Navar do differ in one other significant way aside from sheer size. Their skin tones range from a light tans to darker browns, with their eyes commonly brown or black. Their skin is unusually thick compared to others, and is highly resistant to extreme temperatures, be they hot or cold, as well as to damage in general. This combined with their size makes them prized fighters or guards among those who can afford them as warriors or bodyguards, and few things strike more fear in an enemy than a vanguard comprised of Navar warriors. To outsiders who have little experience they are a drunken, boastful, and arrogant lot who enjoy picking on the smaller races, but this isnât the entire story. They are a proud race true, but loyal to those they serve and to the ones they would call friend; it is their love of competition that sees them challenge others, it just so happens all the other races are smaller than them. Beyond this none can deny the bravery and valiant defense a Navar will put up to save their family or friends, often willingly sacrificing themselves in the process."

They also have the unusual quirk of almost always referring to themselves in the third person. Strong and proud they patrol their plains, an outpost of order and civilization before entering the wild and chaotic Sucari Territories. Their cities and towns are sprawling centers of civilizations, as their peoples need for independence sees them seek space from each other. Even a family compound with high walls might be further subdivided between different members. To their credit, this makes fighting a battle for a Nekanian city one of the most difficult ordeals a military commander can undertake."

Their skin tones range from a pale light tone to darker browns, and anywhere in-between. Their eyes are commonly brown but can also be blue, black, and green, along with many variations in those shades. The singular trait that stands out the most about the Volari is their adaptability, for they are quick to respond both to their environment and find ways to adapt their environment to their needs, the latter at times proving problematic with their interactions with some others. While some see them as weak, and others short-lived, in reality, the Volari have proven to be highly successful. Above all the other races theirs is the race with the farthest reach and most control over the world."

  archetype1DescData: "The different races of Bethica revere a sizable pantheon of gods, called by many names but united in concept. It is usual for religious men and women to serve as members of the clergy, dedicating themselves to the servitude, worship, and advocacy of a single deity. In return for their service, the deity grants their supplicants special powers in the form of talents: for example, devotees of Amriel display a strong affinity for the healing arts, while followers of Raziel are renowned for their supreme sense of justice.  ",
  archetype2DescData: "Depending on the god or goddess they serve, members of the clergy can display a formidable array of talents, from healing wounds to invoking holy fervor to smiting the undead. Occasionally, Clerics who give themselves to deities of darker persuasion can become proficient in a more frightening skillset: exhuming a massive skeleton army to fight in their stead, or unleashing a devastating plague upon the forces of their foes. The most prodigious clergymen of both alignments may even resurrect the dead, although the result of such a ritual cannot be expected to come back whole.",
  archetype3DescData: "Clerics are usually members of religious orders. As such, there are two broad subclasses — Missionary of Light and Missionary of Darkness — and a variety of professions under the umbrella of each.  ",

  archetype1DescData: "As one of the most straight-forward character professions in the Realm of Bethica, Fighters are almost always welcome in any campaign. Representing the main physical combatants of Bethica, Fighters can have wildly diverse backgrounds and styles: they may be anything from a noble hero to an enterprising everyman to a bloodthirsty villain, from bodyguards to former soldiers to bandits to master swordsmen to duelists… or most commonly just regular adventurers. In Bethica, almost every lad or lady who knows how to pick up a blade — and that includes most of the population — could be described as a Fighter.",
  archetype2DescData: "Regardless of their discipline of choice, Fighters tend to be extremely weapon-oriented, with a strategic and tactful grasp on combat. They can be driven forward by many goals, but the most common motivators include revenge, patriotism, love, fame… or just plain and simple coin.  ",
  archetype3DescData: "In combat, Fighters tend to make up the frontlines. While they are also capable of using ranged weapons, the average Fighter much prefers to wade into the middle of their foes and wreak as much havoc as possible. They can give and take quite a beating, using their strength and physical condition to not only rend their enemies but protect their more fragile allies as well. The methods they use are diverse: some Fighters are generalists, favoring the biggest swords and the heaviest bows, while others study a single type of weapon so intensely that their style of combat borders on art. Others eschew weapons completely, training their very bodies as a weapon and mustering powerful battle cries to demoralize their foes, while still others use sword and fang to tear into their opponents alongside faithfully trained beasts.",

  archetype1DescData: "The stealthy and dexterous Rogues are everything that Fighters aren’t. Although Rogues can be motivated by many of the same goals and motives that drive Fighters, and are certainly just as diverse as Fighters, even the most good-hearted Rogue can be decidedly unsavory. They range from sleazily attractive Casanova types to swindlers, to con artists, to smugglers and tricksters. The more churlish Rogues can even be given to skulk many of Bethica’s dark alleyways, relieving people of their valuables through a grubby hand slipped inside a pocket or pressing them against a wall at knife point. The Rogue’s morality comes not from the gods, or from some concept of virtue, but from their own personal code.  ",
  archetype2DescData: "While not every Rogue lacks honor or moral principles, almost all of them are decidedly more devious than the average Bethican. One will practically never find Rogues swinging swords and bashing heads with their brothers-in-arms on the frontline; they see little point in doing so. The true talents of the Rogue lie in stealth and subterfuge. Why face an enemy head-on and subject oneself to potential harm, the Rogue asks when one can just as easily strike from the shadows… or even better, let the laws of physics themselves take care of the situation? Why waste time and energy unsheathing a claymore when a blowgun and a needle filled with poison could easily do the job? In the mind of a Rogue, there are no “rules” in combat; it is downright silly to play fair with someone hell-bent on causing harm to you or those you love.",
  archetype3DescData: "In combat, Rogues are experts at dodging and dancing around their foes, but they generally lack the sheer damage output and the durability needed to survive in direct combat. They have perfected the art of disappearing from sight; whether through magic or deception or something else entirely, the Rogue seems to flicker in and out of battle, reappearing only to strike with a dagger to the throat or a billy club to the back of the head. Rogues have none of the sustained combat prowess of Fighters, but they make up for it with their brutal efficiency: while the Fighter’s strikes bring valorous inspiration and triumph, the Rogue’s strikes bring only the coldness of death.  ",
  archetype4DescData: "Rogues who shy away from the general chaos of battle are fond of using ranged weapons from the faraway shadows, stopping trouble before it even starts with a silver-tipped bolt to the carotid. And some Rogues don’t even see the need to use weapons at all, sipping brandy and snickering from the rooftops as their devious spring-loaded traps literally shred their opponents.",
  archetype5DescData: "Rogues are stealthy and dexterous characters that have special talents for disarming traps, picking locks, spying on foes, and backstabbing foes from the shadows. Rogues are usually capable of melee or ranged combat and tend to be focused on dodging attacks rather than withstanding damage. They often wield two daggers or other small one-handed and concealable weapons. They tend to rely on speed and rapid strikes rather than sheer damage output. Rogues usually have stealth abilities, allowing them to disappear from sight; often this is combined with attacking an unaware or flanked opponent to inflicting high damage.  ",

    archetype1DescData: "Wielding powerful, hard-hitting spells that sow devastation amongst the ranks of their enemies, Sorcerers/sorceress are casters who frequently pay for their mastery of the arcane with their physical weakness — and at times, relative lack of the social graces.",
    archetype2DescData: "Because the magical communities is very exclusive, taught and practiced by few and open to even fewer, most Bethicans have a fairly poor understanding of magic and may outright fear Wizards and other sorcerers. No mortal being can even begin to train and learn the arcane arts until their minds are mature enough. This is usually around 10-12 years old for non-Qu’Venari; whereas Qu’Venari can start as early as 5 years old.  Learning the arts usually requires about 10-15 years of intense and brutal training. Magic can mean many different things to many different people: some view the Wizard’s talents as the result of a heretical pact with dark forces, others see arcane mastery as a gift from the gods, and still others believe that Wizards and other sorcerers are just elaborate illusionists. This uncertainty often results in potential and actual Wizards facing many conflicting attitudes from society. On more than one occasion, a well-meaning Wizard has been driven away by a reactionary mob of villagers after demonstrating his magical craft in public. As such, Wizards tend to favor reclusive, scholarly occupations that benefit from magical skills, such as archiving and field medicine; some of them are completely devoted to these jobs, almost never interacting with the rest of society.",
    archetype3DescData: "It can be somewhat unclear what makes a Sorcerers/sorceress distinct from other spellcasters, especially Mages. The difference between a Wizard and a Mage is similar to the difference between a Warrior and a Weapon Master: Wizards are generalists, not limited in what kinds of spells they can cast, while Mages are specialists who focus almost exclusively on one or two spheres of magic.",
    archetype4DescData: "The average arcanist almost never wears armor of any kind, instead favoring enchanted and ornate robes that amplify the Wizard’s natural reserves of mana. However, it is by no means unheard of “combat wizards” to cover themselves in rune-scribed heavy plate, allowing them to stand tall on the frontlines while wreaking their characteristic elemental destruction.",
    archetype5DescData: "Masterful mages that dedicate their lives to the exhaustive study of magic, sorcerers most closely resemble the traditional casters seen in other tabletop games. The sorcery's spells gain more power through leveling, meaning that while they might not always have access to the most *immediate* power, only the most *consistently* powerful spells are available to them.",
